# If your Python project uses certain packages only for testing or other environments,
# you could use different requirements.txt files (like requirements_test.txt) or a Pipfile if you're using pipenv.
# This script doesn't exactly replicate the behavior of your spec_helper.rb, as Python's packaging and environment
# management systems are different than Ruby's.
#
# If you're using virtual environments (which is a common practice),
# you'll install the testing packages into the virtual environment before running the tests.
# If you're using a requirements_test.txt file, that might look like this:
#
# $ pip install -r requirements_test.txt
#
# This way, you don't need a script like spec_helper.rb to manage your testing environment.
# Your test environment is managed the same way as your regular environment, using pip and requirements.txt files.
#
# pytest will automatically find and run tests in any file that matches the pattern test_*.py or *_test.py (and others),
# so you don't have to tell it what files to run. You just run pytest from the command line and it finds the tests for you.
