# HITSP C32 and ASTM CCR Health Measure Extraction Library

This project is dedicated to providing a comprehensive library for ingesting HITSP C32 and ASTM CCR documents. Our library effectively extracts necessary values for computing health quality measures for any population.

## Key Features

- **HITSP C32 and ASTM CCR Ingestion:** We can ingest and process documents following these standards.
- **Health Quality Measure Extraction:** Extracts all necessary values for computing health quality measures.
- **Population Query Support:** Ability to query and compute over a population, determining the number of people within a population that conform to the measure.
